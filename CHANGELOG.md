# Changelog

## [1.1.0] 2021-03-15

For details, see [ddcutil Release Notes](https://www.ddcutil.com/release_notes).

### Added
- Configuration file **ddcutilrc**, located on the XDG config path.   
- Cache the monitor capabilities strings to improve performance of the **capabilities** command.  
  Controlled by options ***--enable-capabilities-cache***, ***--disable-capabilities-cache***.
- Workarounds for problems in DRM video drivers (e.g. i915, ARM) when displays are connected to 
  a docking station. For example, the same monitor can appear as two different /dev/i2c devices,
  but only one supports DDC/CI.  If possible these are reported as a "Phantom Display" instead 
  of as "Invalid Display". 
- Issue warning at startup if driver i2c-dev is neither loaded nor built into the kernel.

### Changed
- By default, files generated by **dumpvcp** are saved in the XDG_DATA_HOME directory.
- **environment --verbose** has more detailed reporting of relevant sections of /sys.
- Additional information on **detect --verbose**.
- Workarounds for querying EDID of displays connected to docking stations. More generally, 
  these changes apply to displays connected using DisplayPort Multi-Stream Transport (MST).
- Additional functions are traceable using option ***--trcfunc***

### Fixed
- Regard IO operations setting errno EBUSY as recoverable, suggest use of   option 
  ***--force-slave-address***.  (EBUSY can occur when ddcontrol's ddcci driver 
  is loaded.)
- Fix build failure for configure option ***--disable-usb*** is combined with 
  ***--enable-envcmds***.
