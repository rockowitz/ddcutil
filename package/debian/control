# Description: 60 char max short description, followed by long description
# Long description should be a paragraph which gives more details about the package. 
# Column 1 of each line should be empty. There must be no blank lines, but you can put a single . (dot) 
# in a column to simulate that. Also, there must be no more than one blank line after the long description. 
Description: Control monitor settings - Standalone command line version
 ddcutil is used to query and change monitor settings.
 .
 ddcutil communicates with monitors implementing MCCS (Monitor Control Command
 Set). Normally, communication is performed using the DDC/CI protocol on the 
 I2C bus.  Alternatively, communication can be performed over USB as per the 
 USB Monitor Control Class Specification. 
 .
 A particular use case for ddcutil is as part of color profile management.  
 Monitor calibration is relative to the monitor color settings currently in  
 effect,  e.g. red  gain.  ddcutil allows color related settings to be saved 
 at the time a monitor is calibrated, and then restored when the calibration 
 is applied.
