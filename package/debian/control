# Description: 60 char max short description, followed by long description
# Long description should be a paragraph which gives more details about the package. 
# Column 1 of each line should be empty. There must be no blank lines, but you can put a single . (dot) 
# in a column to simulate that. Also, there must be no more than one blank line after the long description. 
Description: Query and update monitor settings
 ddcutil is used to query and change monitor settings.
 .
 ddcutil  communicates  with monitors implementing MCCS (Monitor Control 
 Command Set) using the DDC/CI protocol on the I2C bus.  Normally, the video
 driver for the monitor exposes the I2C bus as devices named /dev/i2c-n.
 .
 A particular use case for ddcutil is as part of color profile management.  
 Monitor calibration is relative to the monitor color settings currently in  
 effect,  e.g. red  gain.  ddcutil allows color related settings to be saved 
 at the time a monitor is calibrated, and then restored when the calibration 
 is applied.
