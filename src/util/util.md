Direcory util provides services that are independent of **ddcutil** and could be used in other applications.

Most files provide general purpose functions such as data structures, and output management. 

Some files, such as udev_util.c, provide functions to simplify use of specific system libraries.
USB related utility files have been segregated to directory usb_util.
