.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBddcutil\fP is used to query and change monitor settings.  
The settings that can be controlled by \fBddcutil\fP are, generally speaking, those that can be changed using the buttons
on a monitor and its on screen display.  The specific settings vary from monitor to monitor.

\fBddcutil\fP communicates with monitors that implement the Monitor Control Command Set (MCCS) using the DDC/CI protocol on an I2C bus.  
Normally, the video driver for the monitor exposes the I2C bus as devices named /dev/i2c-n.  
Alternatively, \fBddcutil\fP can communicate with monitors that use USB to communicate MMCS, provided the monitors meet the USB Monitor Control Class Specification.

The Monitor Control Command Set describes a collection of Virtual Control Panel (VCP) features that a monitor can implement.
Each feature is identified using a single byte.  For example, feature x10 is the brightness control. 

Common use cases include changing monitor brightness and color.  Using scripts, the changes can be effected by keystrokes,
or in response to the time of day.  
Another common use case is to switch the monitor input source. 

A more complex  use case for \fBddcutil\fP is as part of color profile management.  
Monitor calibration is relative to the monitor color settings currently in effect, e.g. red gain.  
\fBddcutil\fP allows color related settings to be saved at the time a monitor is calibrated, 
and then restored when the calibration is applied.


This man page describes \fBddcutil\fP commands and options most important to the typical user. 
For complete documentation, use the \fI--help\fP option or see the web site
.UR http://www/ddcutil.com
.UE .
If option \fI--verbose\fP is specifeid in conjunction with \fI--help\fP, more extensive help on option arguments is shown.

Option \fI--hh\fP shows all options recognized by \fBddcutil\fP. These include deprecated option names (which have been replaced
by more descriptive names), experimental options, and options only of interest to developers.

.SH RESTRICTIONS
\fBddcutil\fP does not support laptop monitors, which do not implement DDC/CI.

Normally, \fBgetvcp\fP does not report unsupported features when querying a feature-group.  This option forces output. 
.TQ
.B "--show-table | --no-table
Normally, \fBgetvcp\fP does not report Table type features when querying a feature-group.  \fB--show-table\fP forces output.   \fB--no-table\fP is the default.
.TQ
.B "--rw, --ro, --wo"
Limit \fBgetvcp\fP or \fBvcpinfo\fP output to read-write, read-only, or (for \fBvcpinfo\fP) write-only features.

.PP
Options that control the amount and form of output.
.TQ
.B "-t, --terse, --brief"
Show brief detail.  For command \fBgetvcp\fP, the output is in machine readable form.
.TQ
.B -v, --verbose
Show extended detail

.PP
Options for program information.
.TQ
.B "-V, --version"
Show program version.
.TQ
.B "--settings"
Report option settings in effect.
.TQ

Show program help.
.TQ
.B "--hh"
Show program help including hidden options. Hidden options include alternative option names,
experimental and deprecated options, and ones for debugging.

.PP
Options for diagnostic output
.TQ
.B --ddcdata
Reports DDC protocol errors.  These may reflect I2C bus errors, or deviations by monitors from the MCCS specification.
Formerly named \fB--ddc\fP,
.TQ
.BR --stats " [" all | errors | tries | calls | elapsed | time ]
Report execution statistics.
I2C bus communication is inherently unreliable.  It is the responsibility of the program using the bus, i.e. \fBddcutil\fP,
to manage retries in case of failure.  This option reports retry counts and various performance statistics.
If no argument is specified, or ALL is specified, then all statistics are 
output.  ELAPSED is a synonym for TIME.  CALLS implies TIME.
.br Specify this option multiple times to report multiple statistics groups.
.TQ
.BR --vstats  " [" all | errors | tries | calls | elapsed | time ] 
Like \fB--stats\fP, but includes per-display statistics.
.TQ
.BR --istats  " [" all | errors | tries | calls | elapsed | time ] 
Like \fB--vstats\fP, but includes additional internal information.
.TQ
.BI --syslog " [" debug | verbose | info | notice | warn | error | never " ]"
Write messages of the specified or more urgent severity level to the system log.
The \fBddcutil\fP default is \fBWARN\fP. The \fBlibddcutil\P default is \fBNOTICE\fP.
.TQ
.BI "--libddcutil-trace-file" file name
Direct trace output to the specified file instead of the terminal. This is a \fBlibddcutil\fP only option.
.TQ
.BI "--trace" trace-class-name
Trace all functions in a trace class.  For a list of trace classes, use \fI--help --verbose\fP.
.TQ
.BI "--trcfunc" function-name
Trace a specific function.


.PP
Options that tune execution
.TQ
.B "--enable-capabilities-cache, --disable-capabilities-cache"
Enable or disable caching of capabilities strings, improving performance.
The default is
.B --enable-capabilities-cache
.TQ
.\" .B "--enable-displays-cache, --disable-displays-cache"
.\" Enable or disable caching of information about detected displays, improving performance.
.\" The default is 
.\".B "--enable-displays-cache"
.TQ
.B "--enable-dynamic-sleep, --disable-dynamic-sleep"
Dynamically adjust the sleep-multiplier over multiple \fBddcutil\fP invocations, improving performance. 
The default is
.B "--enable-dynamic-sleep"
.TQ
.BI "--min-dynamic-multiplier " "decimal number"
Modify the dynamic sleep algorithm to never adjust the sleep multiplier below this value.
This option can help dampen swings in sleep multiplier values.
.TQ
.BI "--sleep-multiplier " "decimal number"
Adjust the length of waits listed in the DDC/CI specification by this number to determine the actual 
wait time.  Well behaved monitors work with sleep-multiplier values less than 1.0, while monitors
with poor DDC implementations may require sleep-multiplier values greater than 1.0.  In general,
newer option \fB--enable-dynamic-sleep\fP will provide better performance.
.TQ
.B "--lazy-sleep"
Peform mandated sleeps before the next DDC/CI operation instead of immediately after the
DDC/CI operation that specified a delay, marginally improving performance.
.\" .TQ
.\" .B "--i2c-bus-checks-async-min"
.\" (experimental option) During display detection, examine I2C buses in parallel to see if a monitor is present.
.\" These are low level checks that do not test DDC communication. The default is
.\" .B "--i2c-bus-checks-async-min 99"
.\" (i.e. never).
.TQ
.B "--ddc-checks-async-min"
If there are several monitors, initial DDC checks are performed in multiple threads, improving performance.
This option was formerly (and ambiguously) named \fB--async\fP.  The default is 
.B "--ddc-checks-async-min 3"
.TQ
.B "--skip-ddc-checks"
Assume DDC communication works and monitors properly use the invalid feature flag in a
DDC/CI Reply packet to indicate an unsupported feature, improving display detection performance.
.TQ
.B "--discard-cache [capabilities|dsa|all"
Discard cached display information and/or dynamic sleep data.

.PP
Options that modify behavior
.TQ
.BI "--maxtries " "(max-read-tries, max-write-read-tries, max-multi-part-tries)"
Adjust the number of retries.  A value of "." or "0" leaves the setting for a retry type unchanged.
.TQ
.B "--verify | --noverify"
Verify or do not verify values set by \fBsetvcp\fP or \fBloadvcp\fP. \fB--noverify\fP is the default.
.TQ
.BI "--mccs " "MCCS version"
Tailor command input and 
output to a particular MCCS version, e.g. 2.1
.TQ
.B "--enable-udf, --disable-udf"
Enable or disable support for user supplied feature definitions.
The default is
.B "--enable-udf"
.TQ
.B "--enable-usb, --disable-usb"
Enable or disable support for monitors that implement USB communication with the Virtual Control Panel.
(These options are available only if \fBddcutil\fP was built with USB support.)
The default is 
.B "--disable-usb"
.TQ
.BI "--ignore-usb-vid-pid " vid:pid
Force \fBddcutil\fP to ignore a particular USB device, specified by its 4 hex digit vendor id and its 4 hex digit product id.
.TQ
.BI "--ignore-hiddev " hiddev-device-number
Force \fBddcutil\fI to ignore a particular USB device, specified by /dev/usb/hiddev device number
.TQ
.BI "--use-file-io | --use-ioctl-io"
Cause \fBddcutil\fP to use the write()/read() interface or the ioctl interface of driver dev-i2c to send and receive I2C packets.
By default, \fBddcutil\fP uses the ioctl interface.  Nvidia proprietary
driver are built in a way such that the ioctl interface can fail, in which case \fBddcutil\fP switches to using the file io interface.
.TQ
.B "--force-slave-address"
Take control of slave addresses on the I2C bus even they are in use.
Has use only with file-io, not with ioctl-io. 
.TQ
.BI "--enable-cross-instance-locks | --disable-cross-instance-locks"
Coordinates /dev/i2c device access across multiple instance of \fBddcutil\fP and \fBlibddcutil\fP.
The default is
.B "--enable-cross-instance-locks"
.TQ
.BI "--edid-read-size " "128|256"
Force \fBddcutil\fP to read the specified number of bytes when reading the EDID.
This option is a work-around for certain driver bugs.
The default is 256.
.TQ
.BI "--i2c-source-addr " hex-addr
Use this as the source address in DDC packet, instead of the normal value.
This option has been found to enable access some control functions when using some displays, particularly from LG.
.TQ
.B "--permit-unknown-feature"
Allow \fBsetvcp\fP of unknown features.

.PP Miscellaneous
.TQ 
.BR "--noconfig "  
Do not process the configuration file
