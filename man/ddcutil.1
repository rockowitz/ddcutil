.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBddcutil\fP is used to query and change monitor settings.  

\fBddcutil\fP communicates with monitors that implement the Monitor Control Command Set (MCCS) using the DDC/CI protocol on an I2C bus.  
Normally, the video driver for the monitor exposes the I2C bus as devices named /dev/i2c-n.  
Alternatively, \fBddcutil\fP can communicate monitors that use USB to communicate MMCS, provided the monitors meet the USB Monitor Control Class Specification.

The Monitor Control Command Set describes a collection of Virtual Control Panel (VCP) features that a monitor can implement.
Each feature is identified using a single byte.  For example, feature x10 is the brightness control. 

The monitor settings that can be controlled by \fBddcutil\fP are generally speaking those that can be changed using the buttons
on a monitor and its on screen display.  The specific capabilities vary from monitor to monitor.

A particular use case for \fBddcutil\fP is as part of color profile management.  
Monitor calibration is relative to the monitor color settings currently in effect, e.g. red gain.  
\fBddcutil\fP allows color related settings to be saved at the time a monitor is calibrated, 
and then restored when the calibration is applied.

Another common use case is to switch the monitor input source. 

This man page focuses on the \fBddcutil\fP commands and options most important to the typical user. 
For complete documentation, use the \fI--help\fP option or see the web site

0x10, 10 
.sp 2
.I feature-group
.sp 2
The following are the most useful feature groups.  For a complete list,  use the \fB--help\fP option.

.PP
Feature group names can be abbreviated to the first 3 characters.  Case is ignored. e.g. "COL", "pro".

.I new-value
.sp
Normally, this is a decimal number in the range 0..255, or a hexadecimal number in the range x00..xff.
More generally, this is actually a two byte value, i.e. x00..xffff, and a few features use this 
extended range.

.SH OPTIONS
Options for monitor selection.  If none are specified, the default is the first detected monitor.
Options \fB--mfg\fP, \fB--model\fP and \fB--sn\fP can be specified together.
.TQ
.BR "-d , --dis , --display " , 
.I display-number 
logical display number (starting from 1)
.TQ
.BR "-b,--bus "
.I bus-number
I2C bus number

USB bus and device numbers
.TQ
.B -g,--mfg

.TQ
.B -l,--model
model name
.TQ
.B -n,--sn
serial number.  (This is the "serial ascii" field from the EDID, not the binary serial number.)
.TQ 
\fB-e,--edid\fP
256 hex character representation of the 128 byte EDID.  Needless to say, this is intended for program use.

.PP
Feature selection filters
.TQ
.B "-U, --show-unsupported"
Normally, \fBgetvcp\fP does not report unsupported features when querying a feature-group.  This option forces output. 
.TQ
.B "--show-table | --no-table
Normally, \fBgetvcp\fP does not report Table type features when querying a feature-group.  \fB--show-table\fP forces output.   \fB--no-table\fP is the default.
.TQ
.B "--rw, --ro, --wo"
Limit \fBgetvcp\fP or \fBvcpinfo\fP output to read-write, read-only, or (for \fBvcpinfo\fP) write-only features.

.PP
Options that control the amount and form of output.
.TQ
.B "-t, --terse, --brief"
Show brief detail.  For command \fBgetvcp\fP, the output is in machine readable form.
.TQ
.B -v, --verbose
Show extended detail

.PP
Options that modify behavior
.TQ
.BI "--mccs " "MCCS version"
Tailor \fBvcpinfo\fP output to a particular MCCS version, e.g. 2.1
.TQ
.B "--enable-usb, --disable-usb"
Enable or disable support for monitors that implement USB commuincation with the Virtual Control Panel.
The default is 
.B "--disable-usb"
.TQ
.B "--force-slave-address"
Take control of slave addresses on the I2C bus even they are in use.

.PP
Options to tune execution:
.TQ
.BI "--maxtries " "(max-read-tries, max-write-read-tries, max-multi-part-tries)"
Adjust the number of retries.  A value of "." or "0" leaves the setting for a retry type unchanged.
.TQ
.BI "--sleep-multiplier " "decimal number"
Adjust the length of waits listed in the DDC/CI specification by this number to determine the actual 
wait time.  Well behaved monitors work with sleep-multiplier values less than 1.0, while monitors
with poor DDC implementations may work better with sleep-multiplier values greater than 1.0. 


.PP
Options for diagnostic output.
.TQ
.BR --stats " [" all | errors | tries | calls | elapsed | time ]
Report execution statistics.  If no argument is specified, or ALL is specified, then all statistics are 
output.  \fBelapsed\fP is a synonym for \fBtime\fP.  \fBcalls\fP implies \fBtime\fP.
.br Specify this option multiple times to report multiple statistics groups.
.br
I2C bus communication is an inherently unreliable.  It is the responsibility of the program using the bus 
to manage retries in case of failure.  This option reports retry counts and various performance statistics.
.TQ
.B --ddc
Reports DDC protocol errors.  These may reflect I2C bus errors, or deviations by monitors from the MCCS specification.

.PP
Debugging options. 
.TQ
.BI "--trace "  "trace group name"

.SH EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT 

Requires read/write access to /dev/i2c devices.  See 
.UR http://www.ddcutil.com/i2c_permissions
.UE

.SH NVIDIA PROPRIETARY DRIVER

Some Nvidia cards using the proprietary Nvidia driver require special settings to properly enable I2C support.  If you are using this driver and \fBddccutil\fP does not 
work with your Nvidia card, you can try the following:

Copy file /usr/share/ddcutil/data/90-nvidia-i2c.conf to directory /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d: 

.B sudo cp /usr/share/ddcutil/data/90-nvidia-i2c.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d 

This file will work "out of the box" if you do not have an /etc/X11/xorg.conf file.   If you do, 
adjust the \fBIdentifier\fP value in the file to correspond to the value in the master xorg.conf file.

(The above instructions assume that the normal location of the \fBddcutil\fP data directory.  YMMV.)

For further discussion of Nvidia driver settings, see 
.UR http://www.ddcutil.com/nvidia
.UE .


.SH VIRTUAL MACHINES

Virtualized video drivers in VMWare and VirtualBox do not provide I2C emulation.  Use of normal video drivers with PCI passthrough 
is possible.
